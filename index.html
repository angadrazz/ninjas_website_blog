      HTML is short for HyperText Markup Language.Basically, it's "code" behind
      every webpage - even this one. If you're just beginning to learn HTML, let
      us tell you that it's a fairly easy task. HTML, without styling, can't do
      anything more than setting a layout,drawing a table, or creating frames -
      but it is handy as it helps you structure the content correctly, which is
      important when you sit down to add style to your HTML.

      However simple this might seem, it is a mighty useful tool when it comes
      to full-fledged web-development . Various tools easily eliminate the HTML
      coding from your work process-but if you want to be in full control of
      your web-page, you'll need to have some command over HTML.<br />
      Through this article, we aim to give you the essential HTML building
      blocks that'll help you get up and running. Reading this, you'll be able
      to understand an HTML source code and even modify it for your own good!

      Tags are what you'll see the most when you look at any HTML source code.A
      tag can ideally be seen as a wrapper to any item on your HTML document.
      Tags tell what magic is to be done on the content enclosed by them.
    </p>
    <p>Let's look at two types of tags:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><tag-example-1>I need a closign tag<tag-example-1></li>
        <li><tag-example-2/>I don't need a cloding tag.</li>
    </ol>
    <pre>in the first example, the sentence is wrapped by two tags. The first one is called the opening tag and the second one is called the closing tag. Everything in between is affected by the properties of the tag. Very commonly used examples of such tags are ,etc.
      The second example tags about loner tags-as in,they don't need a closing tag to function.Although it's not required, these type of tags are often written as  to make the debugging of code easier.
      Common example of such tags are - used for horizontal line,- to break the line, etc.</pre>
